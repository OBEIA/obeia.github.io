<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>As an open-source autonomous driving platform, Apollo understandably is a complex system. Having developed greatly over the years, its architecture has changed over time; thus, its concrete architecture may vary from the conceptual architecture derived from its documentation.  </p>
<p>To derive the concrete architecture, the Understand 5.1 tool, GitHub repository, and a publish-subscribe communication visualization diagram were utilized to determine dependencies between modules. This process confirmed the publish-subscribe, process-control, and client-server architectural styles determined in the conceptual architecture, but also added three new modules—Drivers, Common, and Task Manager—as well as updated the Map module; various discrepancies were found in the Reflexion Analysis process, including direct code dependencies.  </p>
<p>The Prediction submodule was also studied in this process, revealing that this module utilizes a combination of the object-oriented and publish-subscribe styles in its predicting of obstacle trajectories, with four core sub-modules: Container, Scenario, Evaluator and Predictor.  </p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apollo is an open-source platform dedicated to the development and testing of autonomously driving vehicles. As a system that values security and safety while maintaining good performance, Apollo’s developers have created a complex system that largely uses the publish-subscribe style. The system contains a variety of subsystems that provide its functionality while satisfying its requirements, including a Perception module to determine obstacles and details, a Prediction module to predict how the surrounding world and obstacles may change, a Planning module that plans the vehicle’s trajectory, and a Control module that transforms the trajectory into commands for the vehicle to deploy. A conceptual architecture was created by studying a reference architecture <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950584915002177">[Behere and Törngren]</a> as well as utilizing Apollo’s documentation.  </p>
<p>Although the conceptual architecture may describe the system of Apollo to a degree, there are always limitations to what may be extracted via a reference architecture or system documentation. It may deviate from the reference architecture; the documentation may be a work in progress for the system’s current state, and/or omit minor dependencies. Thus, to fully understand Apollo, one must study its code to determine its concrete architecture.  </p>
<p>To derive the concrete architectures of both Apollo as a whole and our chosen subsystem, Prediction, we used the Understand tool at version 5.1, as well as a graph visualization of the publish-subscribe communication within the system, and in-depth investigation of the source code. Dependencies found within these visualizations were compared to our conceptual architecture, and discrepancies were added or removed as necessary. These discrepancies were studied in further detail to understand them in various ways, including their purpose and timing.  </p>
<p>Studying Apollo’s source code reveals three additional modules: Drivers, Task Manager and Common, as well as a module, Map, which contains a component of our conceptual architecture, HD Map, as a sub-component. In addition, although publish-subscribe remains largely what the system is built on, Apollo utilizes direct dependencies in its functionality, particularly to the Map module as well as a Common module, and various calls to include files from different components that help in other components’ function.  </p>
<h2 id="derivation-process">Derivation Process</h2>
<p>Figures 1 and 2 visualize the conceptual architecture that was derived from Apollo documentation and the reference architecture. Figure 1 highlights the dependency relations between various modules, while Figure 2 emphasizes the architectural style that Apollo is largely built upon: the publish-subscribe style, where modules publish and subscribe to topics of interest as their main form of communication with one another.  </p>

<p>The conceptual architecture retrieved from various Apollo- and autonomous driving-related sources is an essential aspect of determining and understanding the concrete architecture used by the system. The process of deriving this conceptual architecture, as well as its details, may be found in our previous report. <a href="https://obeia.github.io/assignment1/">[OBEIA]</a>  </p>
<h3 id="understand-publish-subscribe-and-reflection">Understand, Publish-Subscribe and Reflection</h3>
<p>One way to derive the concrete architecture of a system is by studying its source code, taking note of when modules and files within them reference other modules, suggesting a dependency.  </p>
<p>One method of doing so is via the Understand program. Using a file for this program provided by our instructor, we applied Understand 5.1’s dependency diagram tool; this process produces a visual of the dependencies of the system and allows one to view their specifics. However, due to the publish-subscribe style relying upon a central bus, many dependencies are obscured. To mediate this, our instructor provided another diagram, shown in Figure 3, representing the communication between modules in this style.  </p>
<p>Using these diagrams, we regularly considered our conceptual architecture, adding and removing dependencies as necessary; in considering these dependencies within Understand, we removed test files that did not affect the system itself. When reviewing discrepancies, we also discerned their purpose, timing, and attribution, if applicable, provided in Reflexion Analysis.  </p>
<p>In our study of the source code, three new modules or sub-components were found: a common module, a task manager, and drivers. Further, rather than HD Map, there is a “Map” module containing the HD Map as a sub-component. These modules are described in further detail with other subsystems of Apollo, within the Concrete Architecture section.  </p>
<p>The dependency diagrams and publish-subscribe visualization highlight many different dependencies through the system, notably various dependencies that do not occur within the publish-subscribe communication flow. Some dependencies recorded in our conceptual architecture were missing, whereas many unanticipated dependencies were found.  </p>

<h3 id="modules-and-subsystems">Modules and Subsystems</h3>
<h4 id="cyber-rt">Cyber RT</h4>
<p>Apollo’s architecture is built around a custom runtime framework called <strong>Cyber RT</strong>. Cyber RT has many responsibilities as both a runtime component and a base library for other system modules. At runtime, Cyber manages module loading and most of the inter- and even intra-module communication, through facilities for either publish-subscribe messaging or client-server interaction. Cyber RT also provides code dependencies, including runtime base classes, and utilities for file operations, logging, timing, concurrency, and asynchrony.  </p>
<p>The publish-subscribe functionality is done through a “channel” abstraction over multiple transport types, allowing it to be suited for various deployment scenarios. The <code>cyber::Reader</code> class template allows construction of subscribers to a channel and to receive messages on it, either declaring a callback function to trigger when a message is received or allowing messages to be cached for later observation. In many cases, the callback function is simply to store the message so a reference to the latest one is available for use. Publishing to a channel is handled by specializations of the <code>cyber::Writer</code> class template, which can write a single message type to a single channel. On the wire, exchanged messages are byte streams in the protocol buffer (protobuf) encoding format. Each module includes a collection of <code>.proto</code> files which define the messages it sends. Code is generated from the <code>.proto</code> files at build time, which is used by the publishing module for message serialization, and by the subscribing module(s) for deserialization.  </p>
<p>The Apollo runtime modules are made up of one or more Cyber RT “components”. There are two component base classes that a module can inherit from: <code>cyber::Component</code> (and its various partial specializations) and <code>cyber::TimerComponent</code>. Components inheriting from <code>cyber::Component</code> can declare zero to four message types to listen for and have their main processing logic automatically triggered when a message is received on those channels. Components inheriting from <code>cyber::TimerComponent</code> are instead triggered on certain time intervals. Either type of component can declare additional <code>Reader</code>s, and as many <code>Writer</code>s as required. All components must be registered with Cyber RT to operate.  </p>
<p>The fundamental nature of Cyber RT means that all other operating subsystems of Apollo depend on it.  </p>
<h4 id="common">Common</h4>
<p>While not a running module that provides specific functionality to the system, the Common module contains useful code that other modules may rely on. The contents include global constants (in the form of <code>gflags</code>) for topic names, vehicle configuration and data, access to system-wide parameters through a key-value database, latency recording and monitor logging, operation statuses, protocol buffer definitions that see use across the entire system, various math and parsing utilities, and a class that models the overall vehicle state, among others. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/common/README.md">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<p>As it is not a runtime module, Common does not exist as a Cyber RT component. Other than Cyber RT, every analyzed Apollo subsystem relies on Common.  </p>
<h4 id="drivers">Drivers</h4>
<p>The <strong>Drivers</strong> module contains code for interfacing with the various hardware components of the Apollo vehicle platform. It contains CAN client code, used both for reading from typical chassis sensors and controlling the vehicle. Additionally, it contains interfaces for the more advanced sensing equipment required for autonomous vehicle operation, including cameras, microphones, LiDAR, radar, and GNSS. These sensors are bridged into the rest of the system by Cyber RT components that write their readings to channels for other modules to read. Some Drivers components are subscribed to messages from the Localization and Canbus modules, relying on them for operational information.  </p>
<h4 id="guardian">Guardian</h4>
<p><strong>Guardian</strong> acts as Apollo’s emergency response system, implemented as a Cyber RT <code>TimerComponent</code>. All messages from Control to Canbus pass through Guardian, which decides whether to block them based on vehicle and system status it receives from Canbus and Monitor. In the event of a system error, Control commands will be blocked, and Guardian will instead direct Canbus to bring the vehicle to a stop.  </p>
<h4 id="monitor">Monitor</h4>
<p>Monitor is a <code>cyber::TimerComponent</code> that regularly checks the status of the hardware and software of the system, using various mechanisms including OS-level process checks, and status messages on most Cyber RT channels. It reports results on the <strong>SystemStatus</strong> channel and is also able to directly update Dreamview.  </p>
<h4 id="dreamview">Dreamview</h4>
<p>Apollo’s HMI module, <strong>Dreamview</strong>, includes a JavaScript frontend that allows users to visualize the data produced by other subsystems, and an on-board backend. Dreamview reads messages from all other modules and produces a three-dimensional representation of the vehicle including the current location and planned path and displays the status of the system components and hardware. Additionally, Dreamview contains a map service that other modules rely on, and an interface to allow certain HMI actions to be carried out.  </p>
<h4 id="perception">Perception</h4>
<p>The <strong>Perception</strong> subsystem takes input from physical sensors mounted on a vehicle, including cameras, LiDAR sensors, and radar, over channels from the Drivers module. This subsystem outputs decisions on the state of nearby traffic lights and a list of objects which are labelled with their type, distance from the vehicle, and velocity. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/perception/README.md">[GitHub]</a> The module is quite complex and includes ten different Cyber RT components.  </p>
<h4 id="prediction">Prediction</h4>
<p>The <strong>Prediction</strong> subsystem predicts the future movements of objects identified by the perception module, implemented as a <code>cyber::Component</code> that is triggered by the publishing of <code>PerceptionObstacles</code> messages. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/prediction/README.md">[GitHub]</a> This module is described in more detail in the <em>Subsystem: Prediction</em> section of this report. In addition to Perception, the module reads from Storytelling, Map, and Localization subsystem channels.  </p>
<h4 id="planning">Planning</h4>
<p>The <strong>Planning</strong> subsystem aims to plan the exact route of the vehicle. It first plans short term goals such as staying in a lane, then plans the future trajectory of the vehicle. The Planning module may request a new routing computation if unable to follow the original route. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/planning/README.md">[GitHub]</a> Planning is subscribed to seven channels throughout the system; it is directly dependent on Dreamview, Routing, Localization, Prediction and Map.  </p>
<h4 id="localization">Localization</h4>
<p>The <strong>Localization</strong> module provides localization services to the platform. This module consists of three different Cyber components that each implement a different localization strategy on what sensors are available to the vehicle, the data from which it reads from channels of the Drivers module; providing an estimate of the vehicle's location as output. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/localization/README.md">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h4 id="map">Map</h4>
<p>The <strong>Map</strong> module includes the HD Map found within our conceptual architecture, which served as a query engine for the other modules to provide detailed road information. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/specs/Apollo_5.5_Software_Architecture.md">[GitHub]</a> The Map also includes a PnC Map and Relative Map. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/master/modules/map">[GitHub]</a> It is subscribed to Localization, Canbus, and Perception topics, and has code dependencies on Routing and Planning.  </p>
<h4 id="routing">Routing</h4>
<p>The <strong>Routing</strong> subsystem generates navigation paths, typically from the vehicle’s current location to the passenger’s destination. Another module can request for routing by publishing a <code>RoutingRequest</code>, which triggers the <code>RoutingComponent</code> (a child of <code>cyber::Component</code>). Routing’s logic additionally makes direct use of Map to produce a <code>RoutingResponse</code> which can be used by other modules, notably Planning. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/routing/README.md">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h4 id="canbus">Canbus</h4>
<p>Acting as the interface between the software system and the physical chassis, <strong>Canbus</strong> works closely with the Control and Guardian modules, subscribing to and actualizing commands from one of them according to a configuration flag. Canbus also reports the chassis status to the rest of the system and relies heavily on code in Drivers in its operation. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/canbus/README.md">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h4 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h4>
<p>The <strong>Storytelling</strong> subsystem is a scenario manager intended to coordinate inter-module actions. This module creates “stories”: complex scenarios that may be used by other modules. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/storytelling/README.md">[GitHub]</a> This sub-system does not subscribe to any module topics but does write to topics of its own; it is dependent directly on the Map module.  </p>
<h4 id="control">Control</h4>
<p>The <strong>Control</strong> subsystem employs various algorithms to generate control commands for the steering, brakes, and throttle, depending on the scenario the vehicle is in. Control passes the commands to the Canbus to control the vehicle hardware. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/control/README.md">[GitHub]</a> It is subscribed to topics from Planning and Canbus; it both subscribes to topics of and directly depends on Localization.  </p>
<h4 id="task-manager">Task Manager</h4>
<p>The <strong>Task Manager</strong> contains various routing managers to be employed by the system as required. It writes to a <code>RoutingRequest</code> channel if the routing process needs to be redone. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/master/modules/task_manager">[GitHub]</a> It is subscribed to topics from the Routing and Localization modules and is directly dependent upon Dreamview and Map.  </p>
<h3 id="architectural-styles">Architectural Styles</h3>
<p>Recovering Apollo’s concrete architecture confirmed that publish-subscribe served as the primary form of communication between modules; the method of how it is applied was described in detail previously in the Cyber RT subsystem description.  </p>
<p>The process-control pattern was confirmed in the concrete architecture, with the Control module acting as the controller, while Canbus acts as the process; here, the Control module creates execution plans, which the Canbus reads and actualizes for the hardware, then provides Chassis data (i.e., feedback) to Control.  </p>
<p>Finally, the client-server style of interaction via Cyber RT was confirmed; the Cyber RT API for Developers discusses the process in detail, in that it implements two-way communication in this fashion where a node sends a request to receive a response. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/cyber/CyberRT_API_for_Developers.md#service-creation-and-use">[GitHub]</a> The Routing channels <code>RoutingResponse</code> and <code>RoutingRequest</code> are one such example of this style.  </p>
<h2 id="reflexion-analysis">Reflexion Analysis</h2>
<p>Upon comparison between our conceptual publish-subscribe architecture and the concrete one, several discrepancies were identified in inter-module messaging dependencies. <em>Table 1</em> describes the expected dependencies that were found to be absent in the concrete architecture. <em>Table 2</em> describes the concrete dependencies that were not expected in the concrete architecture.  </p>

<h3 id="code-dependencies">Code Dependencies</h3>
<p>Even in Apollo’s publish-subscribe architecture, the modules and subsystems are not fully isolated or independent. One category of such code dependency makes complete sense, which is any dependency on the Common or Cyber modules. As described previously, these modules both provide utilities and runtime functionality, and are meant to be relied on in this way.  </p>
<p>Another category of inter-module code dependency comes from the use of protocol buffers. Every module that publishes messages includes <code>.proto</code> definitions that are used to generate protobuf serialization code at build time. Subscribing modules that need to deserialize the protobuf messages must rely on this generated code as well, which can be seen as <code>#include</code>s for files ending in <code>.pb.h</code>. This sort of dependency between modules is a requirement of the system, and the benefits of using strict schemas enforced by generated code at the expense of full module isolation far outweigh the benefits of full isolation but requiring either unstructured messages or duplicated message class code. However, one case where this is less expected is in the <code>VehicleStateProvider</code> class of the Common module, which depends on <code>Chassis</code> and <code>LocalizationEstimate</code> protobuf code from Canbus and Localization, respectively, as well as in the accompanying <code>vehicle_state.proto</code> which relies on <code>chasis.proto</code> and <code>pose.proto</code> from the same respective modules. It is unusual for a common module to depend on more specific functional modules, even in this way.  </p>

<li>This dependency is notable since in the initial conceptual architecture analysis it was assumed that the communication was done either by the pub-sub channels or Cyber RT’s client-server mechanism. However, it appears to simply be a code dependency.</li>

<h2 id="subsystem-prediction">Subsystem: Prediction</h2>
<p>In studying the architecture of Apollo, we chose to study one of its core subsystems, the Prediction module, in further detail. This entailed deriving its conceptual architecture, and then forming its concrete architecture, applying the reflexion analysis in the process.  </p>
<h3 id="subcomponents">Subcomponents</h3>
<h4 id="container">Container</h4>
<p>The <strong>Container</strong> stores input data that the Prediction module listens for from subscribed topics; currently, these are Perception obstacles, Planning, and Localization. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/prediction/README.md#container">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>The <strong>Scenario</strong> sub-module defines scenarios that the ego vehicle may be in; currently these scenarios are <em>cruising</em>, which includes lane keeping and following, and <em>junction</em>, which includes intersections with traffic lights and/or stop signs. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/prediction/README.md#scenario">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h4 id="evaluator">Evaluator</h4>
<p>The <strong>Evaluator</strong> separately predicts the path and speed of each obstacle and evaluates them by outputting a probability that they occur by using a given model. It uses a variety of possible evaluators, and most apply machine learning to determine these probabilities; the models utilized in these machine learning evaluators include RNN, MLP, CNN-1d and social LSTM. For example, the Semantic LSTM Evaluator, used for “caution”-level obstacles, generates short-term trajectory points via CNN and LSTM. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/prediction/README.md#evaluator">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h4 id="predictor">Predictor</h4>
<p>The <strong>Predictor</strong> generates predicted trajectories. A variety of possible predictors are supported, including <em>empty</em>, for obstacles with no predicted trajectories; <em>single lane</em>, where they move along a single lane in “highway navigation mode;” <em>lane sequence</em>, where they move along the lanes; <em>move sequence</em>, moving along the lanes “following its kinetic pattern;” <em>free movement</em>; <em>regional movement</em>, moving in a possible region; and <em>junction</em>, moving toward junction exits. An <em>interpolation predictor</em> computes the likelihood of creating posterior prediction results after all evaluators have run, intended for “caution”-level obstacles. An <em>extrapolation predictor</em> creates an 8 sec trajectory, extending the Semantic LSTM Evaluator. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/prediction/README.md#predictor">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h3 id="conceptual-architecture">Conceptual Architecture</h3>
<p>To derive the conceptual architecture of the Prediction module, we studied its documentation. The documentation, found in the module README file, provided details on each core sub-module, as well as a diagram presenting their communication and control flow.  </p>
<figure>
<p><img alt="Figure 7" src="../img/a2/figure7.png" />
  </p>
<figcaption><b>Figure 7:</b> Conceptual architecture of the Prediction module.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="concrete-architecture_1">Concrete Architecture</h3>
<p>As with the concrete architecture of the full system, we studied the dependency diagram formulated by Understand to derive specific dependencies of the system. This, however, has limitations regarding publish-subscribe communication between Prediction’s sub-modules and other modules in the system, as the provided publish-subscribe visualization does not go into such detail. However, a study of the main sub-modules’ code presents that the Evaluator and Predictor modules have publish-subscribe dependencies to other modules.  </p>

  </p>
<figcaption><b>Figure 9:</b> Publish-subscribe communication focused on the Prediction module.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="architectural-styles_1">Architectural Styles</h3>
<p>The visual representation of the subcomponent communication reviewed in the conceptual architecture derivation process led us to conclude that the object-oriented style would fit the architecture. This is as the sub-modules would need to know the identities of one another. The Container identifies and protects specific input data; the other sub-modules may use these specific data, i.e., they need to know which data is which, and from which source it is from. This is supported by direct includes in the code to specific Containers in the concrete architecture.  </p>
<p>In addition to the object-oriented style, Prediction employs some publish-subscribe communication, both in terms of inter-module and intra-module communication. In particular, the Evaluator and Predictor listen for specific topics, which can be seen in their submodule code.  </p>
<h3 id="reflexion-analysis_1">Reflexion Analysis</h3>
<p>Many major discrepancies from conceptual to concrete architecture of the Prediction module are the addition of new sub-modules. These include Submodule Output, Util (Data Extraction), Network, Pipeline (Vector Net), Prediction Common, and the Core/Main Files modules. It was expected that the Vector Net would have been stored within the Evaluator; the Core/Main Files “module” serves as the main form of reading publish-subscribe messages, as well as writing final Prediction output. Thus, any dependencies to or from these modules were unexpected.  </p>
<p>There were two dependencies between sub-modules that were seemingly absent in the concrete architecture. The first was the dependency from Predictor to Evaluator; this was displayed as a direct sequential flow in the visualization within the README. However, comments in the Predictor sub-module suggest that this dependency exists, but instead in a publish-subscribe communication format. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/prediction/submodules/predictor_submodule.h">[GitHub]</a> The other discrepancy was the dependency from Evaluator to Scenario; as with the other dependency, this was expected due to the README, but was missing. As Evaluator largely uses machine learning in its implementation, generating various paths and corresponding probabilities, the scenario may not be as relevant.  </p>
<p>Inter-module publish-subscribe topics were expected to be read by the Container, as it stores their input data; however, this is absent in the concrete architecture. Instead, these topics are read by the Prediction component’s Core/Main Files. This module also publishes to the <code>ADCTrajectoryContainer</code> and <code>SubmoduleOutput</code> used by the Evaluator and Predictor. The Container, included in the Main Files, processes the received data from the main Prediction component file via <code>ContainerSubmoduleProcess</code>, rather than receiving it itself.  </p>
<p>Finally, various unanticipated direct dependencies from the sub-modules to other modules may be found. All four original modules depend on the Common module; the Evaluator and Predictor are Cyber RT components. The Container directly includes the Map, by including the <code>hdmap_common.h</code> file for its obstacles and obstacle clusters.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<h3 id="use-case-1-lane-following">Use Case 1: Lane Following</h3>
<figure>
<p><img alt="Figure 10" src="../img/a2/figure10.png" />
  </p>
<figcaption><b>Figure 10:</b> Sequence diagram for the lane following use case, in accordance with the concrete architecture.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this first use case of lane following, the vehicle stays within a lane while following another car at a safe distance. The diagram in Figure 10 highlights the flow of publish-subscribe channel data. First, the Perception module reads subscribed Drivers messages, which it processes; using the <code>LocalizationEstimate</code>, as well as more sensor data, it determines the perceived obstacles and traffic light status, if applicable. Using published <code>Stories</code>, <code>LocalizationEstimate</code>, <code>PerceptionObstacles</code>, and the <code>ADCTrajectory</code> of the previous cycle, the Prediction module predicts trajectories for the obstacles. The Planning module then plans a trajectory using the <code>PredictionObstacles</code>, <code>TrafficLightDetection</code>, <code>Stories</code>, <code>LocalizationEstimate</code>, <code>MapMsg</code>, <code>RoutingResponse</code>, and <code>Chassis</code>; it publishes the trajectory to the <code>ADCTrajectory</code> channel. This is used by the Control module, in addition to the <code>Chassis</code> and <code>LocalizationEstimate</code>, to create control commands. The Canbus then reads the <code>ControlCommand</code> to send them to the hardware.  </p>
<h3 id="use-case-2-unprotected-left-turn">Use Case 2: Unprotected Left Turn</h3>
<figure>
<p><img alt="Figure 11" src="../img/a2/figure11.png" />
  </p>
<figcaption><b>Figure 11:</b> Sequence diagram for the Unprotected Left Turn use case, centered upon the Planning component.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Use Case 2 is the Unprotected Left Turn scenario. In this scenario, the vehicle is to turn left at an intersection with a traffic light; “unprotected” refers to how the traffic light is not using specific turn lights (i.e., left-only). Figure 11 presents a sequence diagram for this use case, which was created after a study of the Planning component code. After the Planning component reads messages from Localization, Storytelling, Prediction, Routing, Canbus, Map, Perception, and itself, it runs various planners once to plan trajectories. These planners use a Scenario Manager, creating the scenario as well as its current stage (Approach if not yet at the intersection, Creep to move forward and survey, and Intersection Cruise to move through). Tasks are found in a Task Factory, including deciding on the speed and path. Once this is complete, the stage, and then scenario, is finished; the Planners generate the trajectory using trajectory generators, and the optimal trajectory is written to the <code>ADCTrajectory</code> topic. <a href="https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/master/modules/planning">[GitHub]</a>  </p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Certain unexpected things complicated the architecture derivation process. Firstly, Understand is unable to detect protobuf dependencies, which means some module dependencies are obscured since they occur in code generated from the protobuf files. Second, the Apollo developers do not write very descriptive commit messages, and most pull requests that were looked at as being relevant to our investigation had no description.  </p>
<p>Apollo, being a large system, has various modules that are regularly updated over time, and the documentation is not necessarily updated with it; in addition, it may be simplified to the true state of the system for readability purposes or complexity.  </p>
